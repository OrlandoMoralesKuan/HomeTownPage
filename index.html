            <p id="description">The town of Birkenhead is situated in the north eastern part of Wirral and offers many things to visit and explore. It’s also home to the iconic Birkenhead Town Hall, the focal point of Hamilton Square which was first opened back in 1887 and refurbished in 2001.  It still maintains many of the original features inside, some of which can occasionally be viewed during the Heritage Open Days that are held each September.</p>

                    <li><h3 class="place-heading">Hamilton Square:</h3></li>
                    <div>
                        <p class="place-description">Hamilton Square itself is well worth a visit.  Designed by renowned Scottish architect James Gillespie Graham, construction of the square began in 1825 and took 22 years to complete.  Today, Hamilton Square remains one of the most attractive places to visit in Wirral and has the most Grade I listed buildings outside of London.</p>

                        <p class="place-description">Elsewhere in the town, Birkenhead Park is another iconic landmark. It was the world's first public park, designed by Joseph Paxton, and said to have influenced the design of New York’s Central Park. It includes two lakes and many listed buildings, as well as a café within the visitor centre. There is an excellent children's playground in the lower park.</p>

            <p class="place-description">The oldest standing building on Merseyside, <a href="https://www.visitwirral.com/things-to-do/birkenhead-priory-and-st-marys-tower-p44186" target="_blank">Birkenhead Priory & St Mary’s Tower</a> encapsulates so much of the town's history within a small, enclosed site. Founded in 1150, the monks of this Benedictine monastery looked after travellers for nearly 400 years and supervised the first regulated 'Ferry 'cross the Mersey'.
                Finally, located just outside the centre of Birkenhead is the <a href="https://www.visitwirral.com/things-to-do/williamson-art-gallery-and-museum-p7875" target="_blank">Williamson Art Gallery</a> . It stands at the core of the Wirral Museums Service, offering more space than any other in its purpose-built galleries.</p>
